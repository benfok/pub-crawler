# pub-crawler
For curious drinkers with great taste

## Description
Our website allows users to enter a location and be shown a list of the  closest craft breweries as well as being able to locate these on a map. The user can save their favorites to a list. Perfect for planning a night out, a quick beer with a friend or for scoping out a location before heading to some boring work conference.

## User Story (MVP)

```
AS A person who enjoys an occasional drink and is known to travel and explore local brews
I WANT to be able to enter a location and be shown a list of the closest craft breweries
SO THAT I can make a decision about where I want to enjoy my evening
I WANT to see a map showing the location of a chosen brewery relative to me
SO THAT I can plan accordingly
I WANT to be able to save selected locations to a favorites list
SO THAT I can easily visit them later
```

## Additional Thoughts
- To allow the results to be filtered by type of location
- To be able to connect selected breweries together to form a Pub Crawl route
- To offer more information about each location such as a link to a website, opening hours etc.

## APIs
We plan to use the following two APIs:
- https://www.openbrewerydb.org/ for locating breweries
- https://developers.google.com/maps for mapping the locations
