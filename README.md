# PubCrawler
An app for curious drinkers with great taste.

Deployed Site:
https://benfok.github.io/pub-crawler

GitHub Repository:

## Description
Our website allows users to enter a location, or use their current location, and be shown a map of the closest breweries. The user can select the bars they want to visit, and the app will map out the most efficient route for a pubcrawl to these locations. The user can save their favorite routes for later use. Perfect for planning a night out, a quick beer with a friend or for scoping out a location before heading to some boring work conference. 

## User Story (MVP)
AS A person who enjoys an occasional drink, and enjoys sampling and discovering local brews when I’m out of town

I WANT to be able to enter my location, or select my current one, and be shown a map with a list of places to get a drink nearby
SO THAT I can make decisions about where I want to enjoy my evening.

I WANT to select my starting location and choose other locations I would like to check out and be displayed with the most efficient route to visit them all
SO THAT I don’t spend unnecessary time transiting or figuring out directions

I WANT to finish back where I started, and the route should be optimized for walking 
SO THAT I don’t drive and get safely back in one piece 

I WANT to be able to save my created routes to a favorites list 
SO THAT I can easily revisit them later or pull them up when I am out on the town.

## Technologies
- PubCrawler is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
- All functionality and styling was achieved using vanilla JavaScript and CSS, without the aid of external libraries. 
- The information is pulled from the OpenWeatherMap, Geoapify and Mapbox APIs. 
- The site is fully responsive across all devices and screen sizes. 


## Thoughts for Future Development
- Offer more information about each pub within the marker popup, including hours, reviews, etc. Possibly using the Yelp API.
- The ability to share saved routes with friends and to print a route.
- Selecting your own start and end points at separate bars, or at another location (for example your house).
- Expand the idea beyond pubs to include retail, restaurants or tourist attractions.
- Ability to edit the route as desired, and to more easily add and remove stops along the way.
